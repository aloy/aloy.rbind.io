I grew up in central Maryland, and lived in Iowa and Wisconsin before moving to Minnesota.

Things I enjoy include:

- Keeping up with my three kids. 

- Going to the dog park with my golden retriever, Beary.

- Reading. Right now I'm on a Sci-Fi and Fantasy kick. I really enjoy Brandon Sanderson's work, but I'm not sure I can pin down a favorite author.

- Woodworking (though I rarely actually do this!)

- Telling myself I'll start playing my trumpet again after more than a decade away (Maybe this will be the year I actually do it!)
