Right now I’m on a Sci-Fi and Fantasy kick. I really enjoy Brandon Sanderson’s work, but I’m not sure I can pin down a favorite author.\nWoodworking (though I rarely actually do this!)\nTelling myself I’ll start playing my trumpet again after more than a decade away (Maybe this will be the year I actually do it!)\n\n\n\n",
